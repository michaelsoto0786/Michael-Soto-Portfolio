My title is Michael Soto Portfolio, I might change it


I use center to align my text on center

I use h1 tag since its my first header on the page and I treated it like a title
I put my picture, I added to my repo also to be my main profile picture.
I created a list of items using ul which is unordered.
used li to show the item on that list, which is my name
