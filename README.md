# Michael Soto Portfolio
CodeLouisville Project 

the title is MIchael Soto Portfolio

My project is a simple portfolio, I put up a profile picture with two pictures below using a css animation
w3 school was helpful on figuring how to create the animation and make the second picture moving the opposite way.
I also, where I put " This is Michael Soto", I did a simple hover over to make the sentence move to one row.
I use html cheatsheet to use the characters for the two hands pointing down, and put a brief summary about my goals and goals.
Under passion and hobbies I use a container row to have the three column for fitness, Army and cybersecurity, also use a background color grey
to frame my paragraphs. I forgot to mention that I use a border radius for the three larger pictures of myself. 
On my three column cybersecurity, I use h tag to enlarge my explaination for the three buttons. I use a javascript on my index.html for three
buttons to click to show one picture at a time which hide the other two on each click. I use two icon for my social media which is
linkedin and instragram, when you hover it would fade, I like to do that so it kinda show you know what you going to click on.
you can click on and it will direct to the website. I create a simple form where you can leave a comment on "Leave a Comment Below",
this is also a javascript and I use to validate by if there isnt a text, there would be a alert that pops up saying to please
type a comment. When you do type a message, it will capture the values and show it below the "Preview your comment".

To recap I use :
one css which is the css animation for my moving two smaller pictures below my profile picture.
Javascript for my three buttons on cybersecurtiy column where it would hide two pictures while showing one picture per click.
Javascript for my form which validate if no text is input by alert message and store the values below the form since I couldnt use a php.

It has been a blast and I am eager to go the next class hopefully doing the back end development. thank you code Louisville and its mentors.
