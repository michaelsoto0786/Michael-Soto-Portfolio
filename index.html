               <br>👇 about me 👇</br>
               <br></br>
               <div>I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor in Cybersecurity, working on obtaining my Security+ and getting hands on experiences on coding with hopes
                 in learning python and mobile app design. My life time goal is to be a security architect and that involves deep understanding of security and software
                 development.

                <h2>Fitness</h2>
                <p>I love fitness for the reason of being healthy, fitness is my passion because it takes the anxiety out of me, it gives me positive energy to forward for the day. 
                  I would say it gives me strength to go the extra mile in my goals.Fitness is for the body is also fitness for the mind, it brings resilience to see my end goal. Also,
                  confidence, fitness gives me confidence in my ability to be driven and not give up in matter how hard the obstacle may be.

                <h2>Army</h2>
                <p>I serve in the Army for over 10 years, I joined in the beginning to get away, I am sure people who joined had different reasons on why. While my time in the Army, 
                  I learned about discipline and military bearing. Not many people know about military bearing, it means to conducting oneself in a professional manner to bring credit 
                  upon oneself and the Army at all times. It is the ability to project a commanding presence and confidence, uphold standards, and doing the hard right over the easy 
                  wrong in both good and bad situations both on and off duty. I like to believe I instill that.

                <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                <div>
                <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, 
                  cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an 
                  organization.Thats sums up what cybersecurity is about, I have educational experiences in using software tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Security Onion.
